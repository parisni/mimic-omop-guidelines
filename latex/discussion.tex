% about derived tables
Derived tables. It is important that OMOP keeps a level of normalisation in
order to simplify the ETL and make it consistent. However once done, it is
judicious to give access to data-scientist to more denormalized tables and more
specialized tables. Multiple concerns exists about OMOP performances and
optimization. However there will never be a perfect multi-use case table, and
this is the reponsibility of the data scientist to build his own tables,
simplified, specialized for his research and answer efficiently and clearly his
needs.
