%Abstract
\abstract{%
\textit{Objectives}: In the era of big data, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) is highly susceptible to gain
from computer realtime analytics and modeling based on patient close monitoring
and Electronic Health Records. MIMIC is yet the first free-access ICU database.
Numerous studies have shown that Common Data Models (CDM) improve database
research by allowing code, tools, experience sharing. OMOP CDM is spreading
worldwide. 

\textit{Material \& Method}: In this paper, an open-source implementation of transforming MIMIC
into OMOP is presented. 

\textit{Result}: We evaluate the quality of the transformation, the
benefits for analysts and the gains and potentials for community contributions.

\textit{Conclusion}: Finally the resulting MIMIC-OMOP dataset is ready for
reproducible research and is the first open-access OMOP dataset with real
de-identified patient data available.

%\subsection{Chirp-Like Impulse Responses and Group Delay}
%Filtering an audio signal with an allpass filter does not usually have a major effect on the signal's timbre. The allpass filter does not change the frequency content of the signal, but only introduces a phase shift or delay. Audibility of the phase distortion caused by an allpass filter in a sound reproduction system has been a topic of many studies, see, e.g., \cite{DEK1}, \cite{DEK2}. In this paper, we investigate audio effects processing using high-order allpass filters that consist of many cascaded low-order allpass filters. These filters have long chirp-like impulse responses. When audio and music signals are processed with such a filter, remarkable changes are obtained that are similar to the spectral delay effect  \cite{DEK3}, \cite{DEK4}.

In Section 1, we discuss the group delay of a cascade of first-order allpass filters and its relation to the chirp-like impulse response of the spectral delay filter. Furthermore, a multirate method to stretch the impulse response of the spectral delay filter is proposed. Section 2 discusses the amplitude envelope of the impulse response and suggests a design method for the equalizing filter. Section 3 presents application examples using the spectral delay filter. Section 4 concludes this paper.}

Filtering an audio signal with an allpass filter does not usually have a major effect on the signal's timbre. The allpass filter does not change the frequency content of the signal, but only introduces a phase shift or delay. Audibility of the phase distortion caused by an allpass filter in a sound reproduction system has been a topic of many studies, see, e.g., \cite{DEK1}, \cite{DEK2}.
\begin{equation}
\phi (\omega ) =  - \omega  + 2\arctan \left( {\frac{{a_1 \sin \omega }}{{1 + a_1 \cos \omega }}} \right)
\end{equation}

In this paper, we investigate audio effects processing using high-order allpass filters that consist of many cascaded low-order allpass filters. These filters have long chirp-like impulse responses. When audio and music signals are processed with such a filter, remarkable changes are obtained that are similar to the spectral delay effect  \cite{DEK3}, \cite{DEK4}.
