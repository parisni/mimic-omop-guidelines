%Abstract
\abstract{%
This paper discusses the implementation of spectral delay using
filters comprising a cascade of many low-order allpass filters and an
equalizing filter. The spectral delay filters have chirp-like impulse
responses causing a large, frequency-dependent delay that is useful in
audio effects processing. An equalizing filter design and a multirate
technique, which stretches the allpass filters, impulse
response, are introduced.}

\section{INTRODUCTION}
% ICU: a paradox 
Intensive Care Units (ICUs) are particularly sensitive units  where demand of
care is rising\cite{angus2000} and mortality is up to 30\% which is a major
health care problem \cite{icu-mortality}. Studies have shown that intensivists
use a limited number of clinical information concepts to guide the
decision\cite{icu-evidence} and that the medical practices are sparse and
variable. Knowing that ICU patients' health record are highly detailed
including connected devices this is a paradox.

% Medical database hopes TODO/ syntetise
The increasing adoption of Electronic Health Records (EHR) systems worldwide
makes it possible to capture large amounts of clinical data
\cite{bigdata-promise} and big data mining has the potential to play an
important role in clinical medicine \cite{bigdata-mining}. Indeed on the basis
of various patient medical
informations (clinical, physiologic, genemomic, laboratory, imaging, reports,
environement) expectations are:
- minimize costs while improving the clinical outcomes of individuals and
  populations thanks to observational clinical research and real time
  algorithms
- Drug Adverse Event
- Drug/Drug Interaction
- Clinical research
- Personalized medicine 
- Medical Decision Guidance
- Early warning systems

% Existing ICU databses
Several commercial or noncommercial, opensource or nonopensource ICU databases
have been developed

\textbf{CUB-REA} is a semi-automatic collection of 25 years and over 300k ICU
patients stays from 30 distinct ICUs in Paris region and covers administrative
data onlyÂ \cite{cubrea-descr,cubrea-website}. Yet it is subject of 15
international publication and access is under conditions.

\textbf{OutcomeREA} is a manual collection of 20 years over 20k UCU patients
stays with medium granularity data from 20 distinct ICUs in France. Yet it is
subject of 50 international publications and access is under conditions.

\textbf{eICU} \cite{eicu-website} is an automatic collection of 2 years of 1.5M
ICU patients stays from 180 hospitals in the USA and covers high granularity
data. It is a commercial database.

\textbf{MIMIC} (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care) is a
semi-automatic collection of 10 years and over 60k ICU patients stays with very
high granularity (including EKG) from 1 ICU in Boston. Yet it is subject of 300
international publication. It is a freely-available database.

% Common Data Models
All those databases do have their own dedicated model. Their structural model
are all based on relational database but all do have tables and columns with
different meaning and granularity. As an example MIMIC do have two
inputevents tables reflecting its source center changed its EHR. Also their
conceptual model are mostly different. For example MIMIC do have ICD9 for
condition terminology, while french database CUBREA do have both CIM9 and
CIM10. A lot of research have been made on each of these databases
independently. While some studies have shown that results are not replicable
from one to another database \cite{omop-replicability} and that keeping the
local conceptual model \cite{fhir-deep} and structure \cite{imi-protect} of
database for research leads to better outcomes, a dozen of common data model
(CDM) have emerged.

% Choice of OMOP + Existing OMOP
\textbf{Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model} (OMOP) is
a CDM designed for multicentric Drug adverse Event and now enlarges to medical,
clinical and also genomic use cases. OMOP provides both structural (as as set
of relational tables) and conceptual (as a set of standard terminologies) such
SNOMED for diagnoses, RxNORM for drug ingredients and LOINC for laboratory
results. While OMOP has proven its fiability \cite{omop-eval} the fact that
concept mapping process is known to have impact on results
\cite{omop-concept-impact} and that applying the same protocol on different
data sources leads to different results \cite{omop-replicability} reveals the
importance of keeping the local codes to allow local analysis. Several example
of transforming databases into OMOP have been published
\cite{omop-german,omop-nashville} and yet OMOP stores 682 milion patients
records from all over the world\cite{omop-bigboy}. OMOP had 5 versions, and
prones its strong backward compatibility.

\textbf{i2b2/SHRINE} is a medical cohort discovery tool used in more than 200
hospitals over the world. SHRINE is one of the attempt to federate multiple
instances of i2b2. The i2b2 star schema has proven its high flexibility thanks
to the modular design of the fact tables allowing storing numerics, characters
or concepts. Its single terminology model is a path based hierarchical table
does not allow to modelise graph ontology (such snomed). While i2b2 is highly
efficient for cohort discovery, it's model wasn't designed for ad-hoc analysis.
The n*n terminology mapping initiated in SHRINE has been described time
consuming and inefficient.
	
\textbf{Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources} (HL7-FHIR) is a medical
data exchange API specification. FHIR provides a structural CDM that can be
materialized as JSON, XML or RDF format. FHIR is flexible and does not specify
a standard conceptual model so that each hospital can add extension to
implement specific data or share within it's local terminology making each FHIR
implementation sensibly divergent. While some research show it as a promising
CDM for ad-hoc analysis \cite{fhir-google} or cohort discovery
\cite{fhir-paris}, its graph nature adds a layer of transformation making usage
complicated for data-scientists as well as difficult to create standardized
analysis. Finally the model envolves and does not make the asumption of
backward compatibilities along the versions.

%- PCORnet, the National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network (http://pcornet.org/pcornet-common-data-model/)
%        - have been created to monitore the safety of FDA-regulated medical products.
%	- PCORnet Common Data Model (CDM) integrate multiple data from different sources and leverages standard terminologies and coding systems for healthcare (including ICD, SNOMED, CPT, HCPSC, and LOINC) to enable interoperability with and responsiveness to evolving data standards.
%	- The first version of the CDM was released in 2014, and there have been 3 major releases and one minor update since then (last release CDM v4.1: Released May 18, 2018 )

Among the other CDM, OMOP looks like the best fit as it allows both
multicentric standardised analysis as well as monocentric specific modeling and
analysis. Still some questions remains that we propose to answer such the
difficulty of transforming/maintaining an OMOP dataset from an existing one,
how well the initial dataset is integrated and how much data is lost in the
process, how clear and simple the model is to be queried simply and efficiently
by scientists, how well design it is to be enriched by collaborative work , and
finally in what extend OMOP can integrate and makes feedbacks to intensivists
in a realtime context.

However OMOP is very ambitious in the level of work preprocessing and
mapping work needed.
In this study we decided to evaluate
Compared to PCORnet CDM, OMOP (6) :
- performes best in the evaluation database criteria compared with the other
  models (and PCORnet in particularly) : completeness, integrity, flexibility,
  simplicity of integration, and implementability.
- seems to accommodate the broadest coverage of standard terminologies.
- provides more systematic analysis with analytic library and visualizing tools
  from OMOP community : ACHILLES
- provides easier SQL models 
  
FHIR:
- does specify a common structural model
- does not specify a common terminology model, for most of the attributes
- has the descendent of HL7, it primary goal is data sharing at low granularity
  (eg: patient, device level)
- implementation may vary substancialy from one to other instance
- XML and JSON are both not optimized in a computational or user friendly to
  make queries
- API on production EHR are not able to export large amount of data while some
  work are in the process (FHIR bulk export)
- transformation from FHIR dataset to datascientist ready to process dataset
  may be one ETL per instance

OMOP shares the advantages of all above models. It allows local analysis with
raw values, and local terminologies as it stores. It adds values by using a
simple and common structural model. It allows standard analysis when needed,
and makes possible to compare. However, question still are:
- how transforming real datasets to OMOP is complicated
- how much dataset lose information
- how performances are affected 
- how well OMOP handle ICU database specificities

We limited the candidate data models to those designed and used for clinical
researches, and those freely available in the public domains without
restrictions.
% Evaluation
Filtering an audio signal with an allpass filter does not usually have a major effect on the signal's timbre. The allpass filter does not change the frequency content of the signal, but only introduces a phase shift or delay. Audibility of the phase distortion caused by an allpass filter in a sound reproduction system has been a topic of many studies, see, e.g., \cite{DEK1}, \cite{DEK2}. In this paper, we investigate audio effects processing using high-order allpass filters that consist of many cascaded low-order allpass filters. These filters have long chirp-like impulse responses. When audio and music signals are processed with such a filter, remarkable changes are obtained that are similar to the spectral delay effect  \cite{DEK3}, \cite{DEK4}.
