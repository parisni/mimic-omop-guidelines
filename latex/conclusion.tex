% OMOP transformation
The MIMIC to OMOP transformation has needed efforts that remains reasonable. It
is and will ever be a work in progress as the standard concept mapping is a
quite infinite process with constant improvement. Fortunately the released
version is ready for research and already offers the same perimeter of data as
the original MIMIC version and even more with the derived data.

% OMOP analytics efficiency 
As seen OMOP model efficiency has some weaknesses as it looks to put the cursor
more on consistency than on performances. However we have shown that it's easy
to overcome the issues and enhance OMOP with a set of design or technology
optimization and dedicated structure that in the end remains standards and
shareable because derive from the original model.

% OMOP contributions
As compared to the original MIMIC data model, working on OMOP offers the
opportunity to write standard code and analysis that might benefit from or to
other users internationally. The MIMIC-OMOP database is available online on
physionet as well as the original MIMIC database. All the existing work is
publicly available on github \cite{mimic-omop-github} and has been designed to
be easily reviewed, copied or enriched easily accordingly to OMOP or MIMIC
open-source philosophy by any end-user aware of SQL.

% Further work
Future work on evaluation of the existing concept mapping though practical
research studies on both local and standard coding will be made. In addition we
expect to enhance the OHDSI USAGI concept mapping tool to allow international
concept mapping suggestion to transform other foreign ICU databases. Finally
investigation on how to articulate FHIR and OMOP to get best of two worlds
(patient level versus multicentric level informations) and improve care
practically at bed side will be done.
