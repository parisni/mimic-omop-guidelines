% OMOP efficiency 
As seen OMOP model efficiency has some weaknesses as it looks to put the cursor
more on consistency than on performances. However we have shown that it's easy
to overcome the issues and complete OMOP with a set of design or technology
optimization and dedicated structure that in the end remains standards and
sharable because based on the original model.
