## loss of data (try to quantify it)
- percent of records loaded from the source database to the CDM 
    - percent of columns
    - percent of rows
  as have done other studies (1)

- Columns
% of sources columns which fits to CDM
ex : storetime and chartime

## terminology mapping coverage
- ICD-9-CM 
   A part of source data for condition_occurrence was ICD-9 codes. 
   The OMOP common standard vocabulary, SNOMED-CT, did not cover all ICD-9-CM codes (95%)
   Moreover, not all ICD-9-CM codes can have one-to-one mapping to SNOMED, some are one-to-many (28%)

- LOINC
- RxNorm

- % of standard_concept_id = 0 (No mapping concept) per table
Need colaborative work

- % of domain_id not in adequation with table name 

- we have mapped  many source concept to one standard concept
  is it the same meaning? distribution of values sometimes very different

## derived values / data / scores
- F/P, corrected Ca / K, BMI
- Note_NLP
- SOFA, SAPSII

## dat-icu feedbacks (most of queries under 30 second ; simplified model VS MIMIC ; to much normalized for data scientist)
