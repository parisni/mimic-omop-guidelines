# Introduction

<!-- medical database merging: objectives -->

- multiples corpora, multiple languages
- some normalized concepts (LOINC, ICD, ...) but 1. mapping can be improved and 2. other concepts are not normalized
- interoperability
- reproducilibity (through corpora, languages, etc.)
- more data: better outcomes


<!-- medical database modelling - state of the art -->
- i2b2
- mimic
- pcornet
- fhir

Limits of this state

<!-- terminology mapping - state of the art-->
mapping:
- linguistic
- statistic
- infered from ontologies


<!-- presentation of multiple ICU database -->
- OUTCOMEREA
- CUBREA
- MIMIC
- eICU

<!-- presentation of OMOP CDM -->
- thought papers


<!-- this work: improvement on both modelling and terminology mapping -->
- omop provides both:
	- common database modeling
	- common terminology defined as standard
